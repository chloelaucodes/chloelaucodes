### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm [Chloe Lau](https://chloelau.me)

I'm a final year Imperial Computing student, [DoCSoc](https://docsoc.co.uk)'s Treasurer and Marketing & Publicity Officer. I also am one of the lead organisers of [IC Hack 20/22](https://ichack.org) and [IC Hello World 21](https://ichelloworld.org)! I work with [CanCLID](https://github.com/CanCLID) to help make Cantonese digital and accessible.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently dabbling my hands into building an open sourced Cantonese input method/keyboard for my bachelorsâ€™ thesis.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about ML and NN, as well a lot of Computational Linguistics, also dabbling into UX and Design Engineering

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Cantonese Jyutping Corpora Labelling!

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything I contributed, or anything random you think would be relevant!
